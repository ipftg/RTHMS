RTHMS: a profiling, analysis and memory tracing tool 
       for multi-threaded applications on Heterogeneous
       Memory Systems

=======================================================

INSTALL

1. Download Pin, http://www.pintool.org
    Tested with Pin 3.2 and 3.5 on an x86-64 architecture. Compiler flags are set up for Pin 3.5.
2. Change in Makefile to point to the Intel Pin directory. 
    Compile with VERBOSE flag to see more outputs.
3. compile by 'make'


RUN

1. Compile the test application. Debug flat '-g' is needed to get source code information. 
   'make test'
2. Profile the test application with the tool.
   'make run'
